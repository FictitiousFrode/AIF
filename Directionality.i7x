Version 2/170327 of Directionality by Fictitious Frode begins here.

"Provides automated listing of all exits from a room."

Include Epistemology by Eric Eve.

Carry out looking (This is the direction listing rule):
	Let known-exits be a list of text;
	Let unknown-exits be a list of text;
	Repeat with direction running through directions:
		Let destination be the room-or-door direction from location;
		If destination is a door:
			Unless destination is undescribed: [This should cover the Standard Rules' implementation of hidden doors]
				Let throughfare be destination;
				Let destination be the other side of destination from location;
				If destination is visited or destination is known, add "[Destination] [are] [direction] (through [throughfare])" to known-exits;
		Else:
			If destination is visited or destination is known, add "[Destination] [are] [direction]" to known-exits;
		If destination is not known and destination is unvisited, add "[direction]" to unknown-exits;
	If number of entries in known-exits is 0:
		If number of entries in unknown-exits is 0, say "There are no clear exits from here.";
		else say "There are exits [unknown-exits].";
	else:
		If number of entries in unknown-exits is 0, say "[Known-exits].";
		else say "[Known-exits]. There are also exits [unknown-exits].";

Directionality ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter 1 - Using this Extension

The main purpose for this extensions is for testing and development work, when room connections change and updating room descriptions can be easily forgotten.

To use this framework, you need to download and install it (which you probably have if you're reading this) and include it in your story:

*:
	Include Directionality by Fictitious Frode.

After printing the room description, Inform will now print a line listing all the exits from the current location.
If the player has knowledge of the destination by visiting it, the name will also be listed. 
Note that this does not check that the player knows that this exits leads to the destination.

Section 1.1 - Exploration

For games where the player is "exploring" an area that is know to the character, it's possible to set rooms as familiar, in order to have them show up in the destination listing.
Eric Eve's Epistemology extension is used to provide this support.

	The Library is north of the Hallway.
	The Hallway is familiar.

When determining wether an exit is known or unknown, it's not the exit that's being evaluated but the destination. 
This has some implications for rooms that are accessible from multiple directions, and shortcuts.

Secret/hidden connections are not handled, but is a point for future updates.

Section 1.2 - Version History

2015-01-26 (Release 1)

	Initial functionality.
	
Release 2 (In development)

	Incorporated Eric Eve's Epistemology instead of the custom 'known/unknown' property.

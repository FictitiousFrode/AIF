	Section 7.4 - Informed Things

During the earlier discussion on rooms we briefly touched upon some of the properties that things can have in Inform, and even one of the built-in archetypes.

TODO:
The various default properties
Containers vs supporters
Doors

For the programmers in the crowd, Inform uses patterns of properties for polymorphism as a supplement to it's inheritance tree.
Properties that share the same name are implied to be the same property even when defined for different types, which neatly covers up the shortfall of being limited to only one parent kind.
